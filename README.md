# typed.ts

Realistic typing simulations in TypeScript!

## Motivation 💥

This small package provides simple typing simulations for TypeScript or JavaScript. It does not aim to modify the DOM directly, but rather only calculates the strings and provides a callback for you to render.

## Example 🧮
<p align="center">
  <img src="readme/example.gif" height="350">
</p>

## Features 🔥

✅ Simulates typing for any strings

✅ Includes realistic errors and automatic corrections

✅ Configurable typing speed, delay, erase speed, error rate, and more

✅ Custom class names for sections of the string

✅ Add new keyboard layouts and custom characters

✅ No DOM manipulation -> use with any framework (in fact, you don't even need a DOM)

✅ Promise based for easy async usage

✅ Zero dependencies

This project is meant to be lightweight. You will need to write a couple lines of code to integrate it in your app. This is by design.

## Built With 🔧

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Getting Started 🚀

```typescript
import { Typed } from 'typed.ts';

const typed = new Typed({
  callback: text => {
    console.log(text);
  }
});

const line1 = 'Hello, World!';
const line2 = 'slow';
const line3 = 'this is typed really fast, but errors are slow';
const line4 = 'this line is fast forwarded. No errors will be made';

const type = async () => {
  await typed.start(line1);
  await typed.backspace(line1.length, { minEraseDelay: 20, maxEraseDelay: 40 });
  await typed.start(line2, { minDelay: 200, maxDelay: 400 });
  await typed.backspace(line2.length, { minEraseDelay: 20, maxEraseDelay: 40 });
  await typed.start(line3, { minDelay: 40, maxDelay: 80, minEraseDelay: 200, maxEraseDelay: 400 });
  await typed.backspace(line3.length, { minEraseDelay: 20, maxEraseDelay: 40 });
  typed.fastForward();
  await typed.start(line4);
  typed.fastForward(false);
  typed.reset();
};

type();
```
