# typed.ts

Realistic typing simulations in TypeScript!

## Motivation üí•

This small package provides simple typing simulations for TypeScript or JavaScript. It does not aim to modify the DOM directly, but rather only calculates the strings and provides a callback for you to render.

## Example üßÆ

</p>

## Features üî•

‚úÖ Simulates typing for any strings

‚úÖ Includes realistic errors and automatic corrections

‚úÖ Configurable typing speed, delay, erase speed, error rate, and more

‚úÖ Custom class names for sections of the string

‚úÖ Factory to use with any framework or library to handle updates (Like rxjs or Angular signals) (See examples below)

‚úÖ Add new keyboard layouts and custom characters

‚úÖ No DOM manipulation -> use with any framework (in fact, you don't even need a DOM)

‚úÖ Promise based for easy async usage

‚úÖ ESM & CJS exports

‚úÖ Zero dependencies

This project is meant to be lightweight. You will need to write a couple lines of code to integrate it in your app. This is by design.

## Built With üîß

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Getting Started üöÄ

```typescript
import { Typed } from 'typed.ts';

const typed = new Typed({ callback: text => console.log(text) });

const line1 = 'Hello, World!';
const line2 = 'slow';
const line3 = 'this is typed really fast, but errors are slow';
const line4 = 'this line is fast forwarded. No errors will be made';

const type = async () => {
  typed
    .type(line1)
    .backspace(line1.length)
    .type(line2, { perLetterDelay: { min: 200, max: 400 } })
    .backspace(line2.length)
    .type(line3, { eraseDelay: { min: 40, max: 80 }, perLetterDelay: { min: 200, max: 400 } })
    .backspace(line3.length);

  typed.fastForward();
  await typed.run();
  await typed.reset(true);
  typed.type(line4);
  await typed.run();
};

type();
```

## Documentation üìñ

Get started by creating a new instance of the `Typed` class. You can pass a callback function to the constructor, which will be called every time the text changes. In this example, we will simply log the text to the console, but you can use this to render the text in your app.

If you are using Angular or rxjs, check out the [rxjs-typed.ts](https://github.com/LoaderB0T/rxjs-typed.ts) package.

```typescript
import { Typed } from 'typed.ts';
const typed = new Typed({ callback: text => console.log(text) });
```

### Options

Next to the callback, you can also pass some options to the constructor. These are the default values:

```typescript
const typed = new Typed({
  callback: () => {},
  eraseDelay: { min: 150, max: 250 },
  errorDelay: { min: 50, max: 100 },
  perLetterDelay: { min: 40, max: 150 },
  errorMultiplier: 1,
  noSpecialCharErrors: false,
  locale: 'en'
});
```

- `callback` - The callback function that will be called every time the text changes. This is required.
- `eraseDelay` - The delay between erasing characters.
- `errorDelay` - The delay between making errors and correcting them.
- `perLetterDelay` - The delay between typing characters.
- `errorMultiplier` - The multiplier for how often an error will be made. The value ranges from 0 to n. 0 means no errors, 1 means normal errors, 2 means twice as many errors, etc. Can be a decimal number.
- `noSpecialCharErrors` - If set to true, errors will only be made on letters and numbers. Special characters will always be typed correctly.
- `locale` - The locale to use for the keyboard layout. Currently only `en` and `de` are supported, but you can [add your own layouts](#add-your-own-keyboard-layouts).

‚ÑπÔ∏è The delay values can be either a number or an object with a `min` and `max` property. If you pass an object, the delay will be a random number between `min` and `max`.

### Methods

To prepare the typing animation, `typed.ts` provides a few methods. These methods are chainable, so you can call them one after another. Note that the methods are not executed immediately, but rather when you call the `run` method.

```typescript
// All available type() options and their default values:
const typeOptions = {
  eraseDelay: { min: 150, max: 250 },
  errorDelay: { min: 50, max: 100 },
  perLetterDelay: { min: 40, max: 150 },
  errorMultiplier: 1,
  noSpecialCharErrors: false,
  locale: 'en',
  className: 'my-class' // <-- explained further down
}

typed.type('Hello, World!', typeOptions);
// Will type 'Hello, World!'

// All available erase() options and their default values:
const eraseOptions = {
  eraseDelay: { min: 150, max: 250 }
}

// Wait for 1 second before continuing.
typed.wait(1000);

typed.backspace(6, eraseOptions);
// Will erase until the text is 'Hello, '

typed.type('you!', typeOptions);
// Will type until the text is 'Hello, you!'

// This will start the prepared typing animation.
await typed.run(); // Returns a promise that resolves when the animation is done.
```

To reset or fast forward the typing animation, you can call the `reset` and `fastForward` methods.

```typescript
// This will reset the typing animation.
typed.reset();

// This will fast forward the typing animation, skipping all delays and will only type the relevant characters for the end result.
typed.fastForward(); // Returns a promise that resolves when the animation is done.
```

### Custom classes

The type method accepts an optional `className` option. This can be used to add custom classes to the typed text. This can be useful if you want to style the text differently depending on the context.

```typescript
const username = 'LoaderB0T';
typed.type('Hello ');
typed.type(username, { className: 'username' });
typed.type('. How are you doing today?');
```

```css
.username {
  text-decoration: underline;
  color: #ff0042;
}
```

The resulting string will look like this:

```html
<span>Hello </span>
<span class="username">LoaderB0T</span>
<span>. How are you doing today?</span>
```

`typed.ts` will automatically handle backspaces correctly, so if you erase the username, the class will also be removed.

### Use with third party libraries

#### rxjs

```typescript
import { Typed } from 'typed.ts';
import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';

const typedFac = Typed.factory({
  setUp: () => new BehaviorSubject(''),
  update: (textSubj, text) => textSubj.next(text)
});

const typed = typedFac({ // Same arguments as new Typed() except no callback
  perLetterDelay: { min: 20, max: 200 }
});

typed.text.subscribe(console.log);
```

#### Angular signals

```typescript
import { Typed } from 'typed.ts';
import { signal, effect } from '@angular/core';

const typedFac = Typed.factory({
  setUp: () => signal(''),
  update: (textSig, text) => textSig.set(text)
});

const typed = typedFac({ // Same arguments as new Typed() except no callback
  perLetterDelay: { min: 20, max: 200 }
});

effect(() => console.log(typed.text()));
```

### Add your own keyboard layouts

You can add your own keyboard layout by calling the `addKeyboard` method on an instance of the `Typed` class.

```typescript
import { Typed } from 'typed.ts';
const typed = new Typed({ callback: text => console.log(text) });

typed.addKeyboard('de', {
  lower: ['1234567890√ü', 'qwertzuiop√º+', 'asdfghjkl√∂√§#', 'yxcvbnm,.-', ' '],
  upper: ['!"¬ß$%&/()=?', 'QWERTZUIOP√ú*', "ASDFGHJKL√ñ√Ñ'", 'YXCVBNM;:_', ' ']
});
```

It takes two parameters: The name of the layout and an object with two properties: `lower` and `upper`. Each of these properties is an array of strings, where each string represents a row on the keyboard. The first string in the array is the top row, the second string is the second row, etc.

‚ÑπÔ∏è The `de` keyboard layout is already included in the package, so you don't need to add it again.
